The Stopwatch project is a web based application that allows users to measure time in the format of mm:ss:ms (minutes, seconds, milliseconds). The application is built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. The stopwatch includes three main functionalities which are Start, Stop and Reset Buttons: 

  1. Start Button - When the user clicks on the start button, the timer will start counting up from 00:00:00.
  2. Stop Button - It pauses the timer. The time is displayed on the screen in the format of mm:ss:ms.
  3. Reset Button - This button allows us to stop the previous timer and set the timer back to 00:00:00.
  4. Timer Display - All the three values of minutes:seconds:milliseconds is displayed in two digits format.
  5. Alert - This application also displays an alert message allowing users to realise that the maximum time limit is reached, that is, 99:59:99 (minutes, seconds, milliseconds).

Conclusion:

This Stopwatch project is a basic yet useful web-based application that allows users to measure time in the format of minutes:seconds:milliseconds. The application is easy to use and provides an accurate measurement of time made with the help of HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
